                A G‑AIRMET is a graphical advisory of weather that may be
                hazardous to aircraft, but are less severe than SIGMETs. They
                are only valid at specific time &quot;snapshots&quot;.
                Forecasters create graphical objects depicting the areas and
                attributes of AIRMET hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                G‑AIRMETs are issued at discrete times 3 hours apart for a
                period of up to 12 hours into the future (00, 03, 06, 09, and 12
                hours). They are issued at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00 and 21:00 UTC
                (with updates issued as necessary). AIRMET are issued by the AWC
                for the lower 48 states and adjacent coastal waters.
